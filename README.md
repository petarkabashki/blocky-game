Blocky game

Similar to Tetris but you have to click a block to have matching neighbour blocks removed.

Implemented with vanilla javascript/ES6, browserify and gulp

To get started

```
$ npm i
$ npm start
$ open http://localhost:9100/
```

Tasks:

1. Implement blockClicked to recursively remove (or hide) all blocks of the same colour that are connected to the target element.
2. Redraw the grid moving empty blocks are moved to the top of each column.
3. Ensure blockClicked still correctly calculates neighbours after removing blocks.


Feel free to use whatever libs you need to make it all work.

E.g.,

Given:

```
#######
###$$##
###$##$
##$$###
```

After the first $ is clicked the board should look like this:

```
##   ##
### ###
### ##$
#######
```

Clicking and of the # will result in:

```



     $
```
